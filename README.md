ColumnLayout
============

Android View for displaying text in columns. The view takes a CharSequence as the text and renders it to columns next to each other. The column width, text size and empty space between columns can be adjusted. Currently only fill_parent or fixed layout size parameters are supported.

Should work with api level >= 10

The example Activity
====================
Example Activity renders lorem ipsum with images and some html formatting. Clicking the screen will change between text sizes.
